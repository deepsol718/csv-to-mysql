# csv-to-mysql

this is a project about uploading Indian post CSV data to mysql using simple java maven project.
Area of Improvement here is cleaning the data, since some rows has wrong data in Pincode column, it contains String instead of a number
which caused an exception while uploading the data so to handle this I simply used that pincode data in string format.
But there is scope of improvment in it. we can use exception handling there and eliminate rows like this.
